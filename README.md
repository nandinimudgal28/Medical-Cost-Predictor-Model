# Medical-Cost-Predictor-Model
Medical Insurance Cost Predictor

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, and region using machine learning models. The dataset used contains real-world data on medical insurance costs, and the objective is to predict the insurance charges for individuals.

Technologies Used:
-Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning model implementation.

-Pandas: For data preprocessing, cleaning, and handling structured data.

-NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.

-Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization, including heatmaps and other visual insights.

-Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical features).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset using visual tools to understand key factors influencing insurance costs (e.g., Seaborn heatmaps, distribution plots).

Machine Learning Models: Implemented multiple models such as:

-->Linear Regression

-->Random Forest

-->Decision Tree

-->Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RÂ² (coefficient of determination), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to choose the best performing model for accurate cost predictions.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a reliable and efficient system for predicting medical insurance costs based on individual characteristics, which can be beneficial for insurance companies and healthcare providers.
